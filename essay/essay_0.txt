The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of teriparatide administration on fracture healing after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients (26 cases) with atypical femoral fracture who were treated using intramedullary nailing between January 2009 and December 2013. Teriparatide was not administered to 15 patients (non-injection group) and was administered to 11 patients after surgery (injection group). Clinical results were assessed using the Nakajima score and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiographic results were compared for the time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union between the groups. Results: Time to recover walking ability and to decrease pain in the surgery region (VASâ‰¤2) were significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. The time of callus formation, callus bridge formation, and bone union was significantly shorter in the injection group than in the non-injection group. There were 5 cases of delayed bone union (33.3%) and 1 case of none union (6.7%) in the non-injection group and all cases obtained bone union in injection group. Conclusion: The injection group showed better clinical and radiographic results than the non-injection group after intramedullary nailing in atypical femoral fracture. Therefore, we think that teriparatide administration after intramedullary nailing could be a useful treatment option to promote bone union.    Values are presented as number only or median (range).
