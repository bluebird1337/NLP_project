Abstract. Recently a new graph convexity was introduced, arising from Steiner intervals in graphs that are a natural generalization of geodesic intervals. The Steiner tree of a set W on k vertices in a connected graph G is a tree with the smallest number of edges in G that contains all vertices of W . The Steiner interval I(W ) of W consists of all vertices in G that lie on some Steiner tree with respect to W . Moreover, a set S of vertices in a graph G is k-Steiner convex, denoted g k -convex, if the Steiner interval I(W ) of every set W on k vertices is contained in S. In this paper we consider two types of local convexities. In particular, for every k > 3, we characterize graphs with g k -convex closed neighborhoods around all vertices of the graph. Then we follow with a characterization of graphs with g 4 -convex closed neighborhoods around all g 4 -convex sets of the graph.  INTRODUCTION  The study of abstract convexity began in the early fifties and is extensively studied in van de Vel's monograph [14] , where the interval convexity is used for introducing it. The theory of axiomatic convexity is based on just three natural conditions, imposed on a family of subsets of a given set. Definition 1. [14] . A family C of subsets of a set X is called a convexity on X if (C1) the empty set ∅ and universal set X are in C;  (C2) C is stable for intersections, that is, if D ⊆ C is non-empty, then D is in C;  (C3) C is stable for nested unions, that is, if D ⊆ C is non-empty and totally ordered by inclusion, then D is in C. The pair (X, C) is called a convex structure (convexity space) and the members of C are called convex sets.  1  From axioms (C1) and (C2) it follows that for any subset A of a convex structure X there exists the smallest convex set [A] = {C; A ⊆ C ∈ C} that contains A and it is called the convex hull of A. Several natural convexities were studied also in graphs, and problems such as determining the convex hull of points and sets in graphs have been investigated. The most known graph convexities are defined using the intervals of a certain type, such as the geodesic or the monophonic intervals. The corresponding convexities, introduced by Farber and Jamison [8] , are the geodesic and the monophonic convexities, in which the convex sets are defined simply as the sets S in which all intervals (of a certain type) between elements from S lie in S. So a set S of vertices in a graph G is g-convex (m-convex) if it contains the geodesic (monophonic) interval between every pair of vertices in S. For a more extensive study on this topic see [5] . Recently Cáceres and Oellermann [3] introduced a new convexity in graphs that is defined in terms of Steiner intervals in graphs. Recall that for a connected graph G, the Steiner distance d(S) of a set S with at least two vertices is the size of the smallest connected subgraph of G containing S. Such connected subgraph is a tree and it is called Steiner tree for S. The Steiner interval I(S) of S is the set of all vertices that lie on some Steiner tree for S. Steiner intervals have been studied in several papers, e.g. [1, 10, 13] . Now, a set S of vertices in a graph G is k-Steiner convex [3] , denoted by g k -convex, if the Steiner interval I(R) of every set R on k vertices is contained in S, that is I(R) ⊆ S. Note that a set S is g 2 -convex if and only if it is g-convex, thus the Steiner convexity is a natural generalization of the geodesic convexity. Several properties of convexities have been investigated. One of them involves extreme points, where a point x of a convex set X is an extreme point of X if X −{x} is convex. The problem in this case is to find characterizations of graphs for which a given convexity presents a convex geometry, i.e., a convexity where each convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points. Such characterizations for the g-and m-convexity are given in [8] , for the g 3 -convexity in [12] and for the m-convexity in [4] . Farber and Jamison [9] introduced local convexities of graphs and investigated them for geodesic and monophonic convexities. They introduced four types of local convexities, arising from convexities of j-balls of vertices and sets, respectively. First some notations. In this paper all graphs will be finite with no loops and multiple edges. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and x, y ∈ V . We will write x ∼ y if x and y are adjacent in G and x y, otherwise. The distance d G (x, y) between vertices x and y is the length of an x, y-geodesic, i.e., a shortest path between x and y in G. Now we present the above mentioned four local conditions which can be investigated with respect to any convexity associated with the vertex set of a graph G = (V, E). is convex for every v ∈ V and every j ≥ 1. is convex for every convex set S ⊆ V and every j ≥ 1. It is not hard to see that graphs in which N [S] is convex for every convex set S ⊆ V are exactly the graphs in which N j [S] is convex for every convex set S ⊆ V and every j ≥ 1 in terms of any convexity in graphs, see [6] . Thus it suffices to consider only the first three types of local convexities. Henning, Nielsen and Oellermann recently studied the same local convexities for the g 3 -convexity [7] . They characterized the graphs in which N [v] is g 3 -convex for every vertex v of a graph and the graphs in which N [S] is g 3 -convex for every g 3 -convex set S of a graph. Necessary conditions for the family of g 3 -convex sets to satisfy the local convexity property 2 are given in [7] . It was subsequently shown in [2] that these conditions are also sufficient. A generalization of the m-convexity based on minimal trees between three or more vertices was introduced in [4] and the corresponding local convexity properties have been investigated in [11] . For k > 3, local k-Steiner convexities have not been studied yet, so this problem will be the main topic of this paper. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove several lemmas that are used in the rest of the paper. Then, in Section 3, we characterize graphs in which N [v] is g n -convex for every vertex v of G. We present such characterization for every n > 1. Then we follow with a section in which we characterize graphs with g 4 -convex closed neighborhoods around g 4 -convex sets. Finally we give some open problems about local Steiner convexities.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS  In this section we present some preliminary observations and prove several lemmas, which will be used during the paper. A subdivision of a graph G is a graph obtained from G by inserting vertices of degree 2 into the edges of the graph. Let G be a graph and T an x 1 , x n -path of G. To simplify notation, we denote such path by T [x 1 , x n ]. The notation T [x 1 , x i , x j , x n ] specifies that the path T goes from x 1 to x n and passes through x i and x j , where x i is before x j on this path. First we describe the structure of any Steiner tree of a set R on four vertices. It is readily seen that a Steiner tree for a set of four vertices is isomorphic to one of the trees described in the following lemma. • a subdivision of K 1,4 ; • a tree with four leaves, two vertices of degree 3 and some vertices (if any) of degree 2; • a path. Let G be a graph, v ∈ V (G) and let S be an arbitrary g 4 The next two lemmas give some properties of g 4 -convex sets whose closed neighborhoods are not g 4 -convex. Similar results were established for g 3 -convex sets [7] . A graph G that contains no graph F as an induced subgraph is called an F -free graph. Furthermore, if G contains no graph from a family F as induced subgraph, then we say that G is F -free.  Lemma 4. Let G be a connected P 5 -free graph which contains a g  4 -convex set S such that N [S] is not g 4 -convex. Let R = {a, b, c, d} ⊆ N [  S] be a set with the smallest d(R) such that I(R) N [S]. Then for any Steiner tree T of R with  V (T ) N [S], we have V (T ) ∩ N [S] = R.  Proof.  Assume, to the contrary, that there exists  Let T be a Steiner tree for R with V (T ) Figure (c) ). Thus we may assume that d ∼ c. Again using the fact that G is P 5 -free we get that G contains at least one edge from {ad , bd }. Depending on which of those two edges appear in G, we get one of forbidden induced subgraphs from F (shown in Figure (c) or (e)) or from F \ F. Therefore we may assume that x a and x ∼ b. Since G is P 5 -free there is at least one edge from {ad , bd }. If a ∼ d , then using the fact that G is P 5 -free, we get that c ∼ d which implies that G contains one of forbidden induced subgraphs from F (shown in Figure (c  Suppose that G is F -free. Let S ⊆ V be an arbitrary g 4 -convex set in G. , x a is not adjacent to at least one vertex from {b, c, d},  say b. Therefore the vertices a , a, x a , x, b , c either induce a forbidden subgraph from F (shown in Figure (c) ) or they induce a subgraph that contains an induced P 5 , which both leads to a contradiction. Thus d(R) = 4, i.e., all vertices from R are adjacent to x. Since G is F -free not all vertices from R can be adjacent to a . We may assume that b a . Let b be a neighbor of b in S. Since G is P 5 -free there is at least one edge from {a b , ab } in G. First suppose that a ∼ b . Then G contains a forbidden induced subgraph from F (shown in Figure ( Figure (d) ) or from F \ F. Therefore G contains exactly one edge from {d a, d b} and exactly one edge from {xa, xb} (two edges from either set would give a forbidden subgraph from F \ F). Since a and b appear symmetrically it is enough to check two cases. In the first case let x and d have the same neighbor from {a, b}, which implies that G contains a forbidden subgraph from F (shown in Figure  ( Figure (c)) , a contradiction. Hence we may assume that d(R) = 4. We distinguish two cases. Case 1: a z. Since G is P 5 -free, d is adjacent to at least one vertex from {a, b} .  If a ∼ d , then the vertices a, b, z, d, d , c induce in G one of the forbidden subgraphs from F (shown in Figure (a) or (c) Proof. Let G be a connected graph in which N [S] is a g 4 -convex set for every g 4 -convex set S. Let v ∈ V (G). As S = {v} is g 4 -convex, it follows from Theorem 5 that G is (F \ F)-free. Suppose now that G contains a graph H from family F as induced subgraph. Let S be the set of vertices in H marked with square in Figure  . Since the set S contains at most three vertices it is a g 4 -convex set and it is easy to check that N [S] is not a g 4 -convex set, a contradiction. Thus G is also an F -free graph.  GRAPHS FOR WHICH CLOSED NEIGHBORHOODS OF VERTICES ARE g n -CONVEX  In this section we use forbidden induced subgraphs to characterize graph Theorem 5. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and n ≥ 2. Then the following assertions are equivalent:  G contains no induced subgraph G , where G is a graph with  Proof. Assume first that G satisfies Condition 1 of Theorem 5. Suppose that G contains an induced subgraph G described in Condition 2 of Theorem 5 and let Thus R contains n vertices. From Statements (2c) and (2d) it follows that d(R) = n. Using Statement (2e), we can find a tree T with V (T ) = V (G ) \ {v 1 }, which is a Steiner tree for R and is not contained in For the converse suppose that G satisfies Condition 2 of Theorem 5. Then G satisfies all the statements from Condition 2, which is a contradiction. The above theorem gives rise to the following problem.  Problem 1.  Is there a characterization of graphs which satisfies any other type of local n-Steiner convexities, for n > 3? In the following section we restrict ourselves to the case: n = 4.  GRAPHS FOR WHICH CLOSED NEIGHBORHOODS OF g 4 -CONVEX SETS ARE g 4 -CONVEX  In this section we characterize graphs with g 4 -convex closed neighborhoods around g 4 -convex sets using forbidden induced subgraphs. To prove the main theorem we need the following result.  Lemma 6. Let G be a connected F -free graph which contains a g 4 -convex set  S such that N [S] is not g 4 -convex. Let R = {a, b, c, d} ⊆ N [S] be a set with the smallest d(R) such that I(R) N [S]. Then R ∩ S = ∅.
